# RISCV-NEORV32 on PYNQ

This repo contains the work done on getting the NEORV32 soft-processor to work on Xilinx PYNQ boards.

Current there are 2 sets of files, separated based on which system they are meant to run on.
<ul>
<li>Board-files, files meant to be run on the PYNQ board. Mostly program generation and runtime files</li>
<li>Desktop-files, files meant to be run on a desktop/host computer. Mostly VIvado script files for generating/modifying the PYNQ overlays</li>
</ul>
