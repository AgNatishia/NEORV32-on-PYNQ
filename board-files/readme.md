There are currently 3 groups of board files :

<li>toolchain, this is the compiled RISCV toolchain for use on the PYNQ boards, this should be copied onto the boards in a location that can be found by the path environment variable</li>
<li>Overlays, these are the PYNQ overlays supplied with this repo, they were generated using the tcl scripts found in the desktop-file section of this repo</li>
<li>Notebooks, these are example programs for the PYNQ overlays, each program has its own folder, notebook, and support files (make and magic files)</li>
</ul>
